# GROUP VACATION SPENDINGS

A command line based Python program to handle data automation for a fictional group of people who are on vacation and will track their common spendings(such as restaurant bills, tickets fees, taxi bills,etc...).

Idea is that, at the end of the day, provide amount that every member have spent that day on common activities. The program will then update total amount spent by each member and print it to terminal.
Then it will calculate average spending and compare to every member spending and calculate difference towards calculated average spending and print it to terminal.

In that way the whole group will have accurate numbers in spendings and could compare and adjust their spendings under or at the end of vacation.
